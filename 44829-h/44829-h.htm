<span class="smaller">A BELGIAN CHRISTMAS EVE</span></h2>

<p class="direction"><i>The action takes place in a Belgian
village, during the War of 1914.
The scene is a room in the doctor&rsquo;s
house. On the right there is a
door opening to the street, a window
with red curtains, and a desk
under the window. On the left
there is a large cupboard with a
door on either side of it, one
leading to a bedroom and the
other to the kitchen. At the back
an open fire is burning brightly.
Over the fireplace there is a reproduction
in colours of the Dresden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Madonna. The room is lit only
by the firelight and two candles in
brass candlesticks, on a black oak
table, at which the two soldiers are
seated, playing cards and drinking
beer.</i></p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Rada</span>, a dark handsome woman, sits
on a couch to the left of the fire,
with her head bowed in her hands,
weeping.</i></p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Nanko</span> sits cross-legged on a rug before
the fire, rubbing his hands, snapping
his fingers, and chuckling to himself.</i></p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Tarrasch</span> (<i>throwing down the cards</i>).</p>

<p>Pish! You have all the luck. (<i>He
turns to <span class="smcap">Rada</span></i>) Look here, my girl,
where is the use of snivelling? We&rsquo;ve
been killing pigs all day and now we
want to unbuckle a bit. You ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
to think yourself infernally lucky to
be alive at all, and I&rsquo;m not sure that
you will be so fortunate when the
other boys come back. Wheedled them
out of the house finely, didn&rsquo;t you?
On a fine wildgoose chase, too. Hidden
money! Refugees don&rsquo;t bury their
money and leave the secret behind
them. You&rsquo;ve been whimpering ever
since we two refused to believe you.
What&rsquo;s your game, eh? I warn you
there&rsquo;ll be hell to pay when they come
back.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Rada</span> (<i>sobbing and burying her face</i>).</p>

<p>God, be pitiful!</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Tarrasch.</span></p>

<p>This is war, this is! And you can&rsquo;t
expect war to be all swans and shining
armour. No&mdash;nor smart uniforms either.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
Look at the mud my friend and I
have already annexed from Belgium.
Brander, you know it&rsquo;s a most astonishing
fact; but I have remarked it
several times. Those women whose
eyes glitter at the sight of a spiked
helmet are the first to be astonished
by the realities of war. They expect
the dead to jump up and kiss them
and tell them it is all a game, as
soon as the battle is ended. No, no,
my dear; it&rsquo;s only in war that one
sees how small is one&rsquo;s personal happiness
in comparison with greater things.
Isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p class="direction">(<i>He fills a glass and drinks.
<span class="smcap">Brander</span> lights a cigar.</i>)</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Nanko.</span></p>

<p>Exactly. In times of peace we forget
those eternal silences. We value<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
life too highly. We become domesticated.
Why, I suppose in this magnificent
war there have been so many
women and children killed that they
would fill the great Cloth Hall at
Ypres; and, as for the young men,
there have been so many slaughtered
that their dead bodies would fill St.
Peter&rsquo;s at Rome. Why, I suppose they
would fill the three hundred abbeys of
Flanders and all the cathedrals in the
world chock-full from floor to belfry,
wouldn&rsquo;t they? How Goya would have
loved to paint them! Can&rsquo;t you see it?</p>

<p>But perhaps if Goya were living to-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>day
he would prefer to pack them into
Chicago meat factories, with the intellectuals
dancing outside like marionettes,
and the unconscious Hand of God
pulling the strings. You know one of
their very latest theories is that He is
a somnambulist.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Tarrasch</span> (<i>to <span class="smcap">Rada</span></i>).</p>

<p>You should read Schopenhauer, my
dear, and learn to estimate these
emotions at their true value. You
would then be able to laugh at these
feelings which seem to you now so
important. It is the mark of <i>Kultur</i>
to be able to laugh at all sentiments.
Isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>The priests, I suppose, are still balancing
themselves on the tight-rope, over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
jaws of the crowd. The poor old Pope
did his best for his Master, when the
Emperor asked him for a blessing on the
war. &ldquo;<i>I</i> bless Peace,&rdquo; said the Pope;
but nobody listened. I composed a little
poem about that. I called it St. Peter&rsquo;s
Christmas. It went like this:&mdash;</p>

<p>Excellent! Excellent! (<i>To <span class="smcap">Rada</span></i>)
You should have seen our brave

Brander&mdash;at a little village near Termonde.
They made the old vicar and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>

<p>They were beginning to find out the
provincialism of their creeds in England.
The pessimism of Schopenhauer had
taught them much; and if it had not
been for this last treachery, this last
ridiculous outburst of the middle-class
mind on behalf of what they call honour,
we should have continued to tolerate (if
not to enjoy), in Berlin, those plays by
Irishmen which expose so wittily the
inferior <i>Kultur</i>, the shrinking from
reality, of their (for the most part)
not intellectual people. I have the
honour, madam, to request that you
should no longer make this unpleasant
sound of weeping. You irritate my
nerves. Have you not two men quartered
upon you instead of one? And
are they not university students? If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
your husband and the rest of the
villagers had not resisted our advance,
they might have been alive, too. In

better. Isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p class="direction">(<i>He lights a cigar.</i>)</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Nanko.</span></p>

<p>Exactly! Exactly! You remember,
Rada, I used to be a schoolmaster myself
in the old days; and if <i>you</i> knew
what <i>I</i> know, you wouldn&rsquo;t cry, my
dear. You&rsquo;d understand that it&rsquo;s entirely
a question of the survival of the fittest.
A biological necessity, that&rsquo;s what it
is. And Haeckel himself has told us
that, though we may resign our hopes
of immortality, and the grave is the
only future for our beloved ones, yet
there is infinite consolation to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>

<p class="caption">THE OLD DANCE OF CHARLATANS AND BEASTS</p>
</div>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Brander.</span></p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t you trouble about God. What
can <i>He</i> do when both sides go down
on their marrow-bones? He can&rsquo;t make
both sides win, can He?</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Nanko.</span></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how the intellectuals prove He
doesn&rsquo;t exist. Either He is not almighty,
they say, or else He is unjust enough not
to make both sides win. But all those
anthropomorphic conceptions are out of
date now, even in England, as this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
gentleman very truly said. You see, it
was so degrading, Rada, to think that
God had anything in common with
mankind (though love was once quite
fashionable), and as we didn&rsquo;t know of
anything higher than ourselves we were
simply compelled to say that He resembled
something lower, such as earthquakes,
and tigers, and puppet-shows,
and ideas of that sort. Reality above
all things! You may see God in
sunsets; but there was nothing <i>real</i>
about the <i>best</i> qualities of mankind.
It&rsquo;s curious. The more intellectual and
original you are, the lower you have to
go, and the more likely you are to
end in the old dance of charlatans and
beasts. I suppose that&rsquo;s an argument
for tradition and growth. If we call it
Evolution, nobody will mind very much.</p>

<p>Look here, we&rsquo;ve had enough of this
music. I&rsquo;ve been watching you, and
there&rsquo;s more upon your mind than
sorrow for the dead. Why were you
so anxious to wheedle us all out of the
house? Tarrasch has warned you
there&rsquo;ll be hell to pay when the others
come back. What was the game, eh?
You&rsquo;d better tell me. You couldn&rsquo;t have

<p>No, you were not going to try that.
You&rsquo;ve something to hide, here, in the
